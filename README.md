# Unity-AudioVisualization-
Messy clump of hobby code meant to play songs with a simple visualization. Lots random stuff laying about in there from my learning/testing process.
Hopefully I'll be getting things tidy shortly, but if you're feeling brave, take a look and feel free to contribute!


## What to do:

Create a link to your music folder under StreamingAssets/Music, or dump a few songs in there.

Hit Play in the Editor, then press the Spacebar. Arrow keys control the camera motion, "S" skips to a random track. Numbered keys (non-keypad) should skip around the song.

## NOTES:

Right now the color effects are hard-coded in for white bars that glow green while I was messing around. I'll revert that code later so that the material prefabs assigned in the inspector are actually used properly again.
